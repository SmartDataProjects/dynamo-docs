History
-------

The development of Dynamo started in 2014 by the CMS Computing Operations organization and was initially foreseen to be a tool working on top of the existing CMS data transfer engine PhEDEx. During the last year Dynamo evolved its capabilities to take over the organization of the data transfers and provide a complete package to manage data using, DBS as the source for the initial definition of the metadata, FTS to perform the specific data transfers and the CMS popularity service to track the usage of the data.

As the package emerged from the CMS operations, it was initially coupled to the CMS environment. However, in the last half year, CMS-specific components have been decoupled, and a standalone version, ready to be used by other experiments, has been produced allowing external specialized plugins for services like the popularity or a master metadata source describing the data. We are looking forward to supporting other efforts where large amount of data has to be managed across a potentially heterogeneous set of storage sites. We do support a fully integrated tape storage.
