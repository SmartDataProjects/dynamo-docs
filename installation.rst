Installation
------------

Presently our installation relies on the person installing having root access and performing a git clone operation and than a number of steps to setup the database, performing some configuration and then importing the data and validating the full setup. Please, make sure to login as root to perform the installation.

Prerequisites
.............

* A Linux machine with sufficient RAM (~20 GB used for CMS installation with 6 million objects)

  * The software itself does not depend on the distribution, but the server daemon scripts are only written for RHEL 6 and 7.

* Super-user access to the installation machine
* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* MySQL server with root access
* MySQLdb python module, provided by MySQL-python RPM
* The REST API requires an HTTP(S) server with FastCGI capabilities (`Lighttpd <https://www.lighttpd.net/>`_ is recommended)
* Host X509 certificate
* User X509 certificates
* Some non-default Python modules (available in e.g. `EPEL <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ repository)

  * `ssl` (required)
  * `sqlite3` (required)
  * `flup` (required for REST API)
  * `fts3` (required for file operations using `FTS3 <https://fts.web.cern.ch/>`_)
  * `gfal2` (required for file operations using `GFAL2 <https://dmc.web.cern.ch/projects/gfal-2/home>`_)
  * `lzma` (required for Detox)
  * `rrdtool` (required for Dealer monitoring)

Basic Installation
..................

The core software and most of the functionalities are contained in the `dynamo <https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo>`_ package. To start login as root and make a temporary directory:
::
   
   su -
   mkdir tmp   

First clone the package:
::

   git clone https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo
   
Configure the package as described in the next section. Please do this before moving on to installation!

Finally, after you have done the configuration run the installation script:
::
   
   ./dynamo/install.sh

   
Configuration
.............

There are a few steps to follow before running the installation script:

#. Copy configuration template to default location and edit the contents. Default configuration should work for most cases.
   ::

      cd dynamo
      cp dynamo.cfg.template dynamo.cfg 
   
   Installation target directories are configurable see the `config file itself <https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo/blob/master/dynamo.cfg.template>`_ for details.

   The server and all applications will be run under a normal UNIX user, which can be specified in the configuration file but must be created beforehand (see 'user' line in the 'server' section in the configuration file dynamo.cfg).

   Please, make sure that the certificates in the server_conf variable exist and are correctly working. To verify you can use a openssl command like:
   ::

      openssl x509 -in <certificate> -noout -text

   and see whether the certificate is valid under the 'Validity' printout.

#. Copy default json configuration template to its default location and edit the contents.
   ::

      cd dynamo
      cp defaults.json.template defaults.json

   Edit the following items:
   
   - Passwords for MySQL users (three lines; you can choose, but must be identical to what is set in the next bullet: grants.json)
   - X509 certificate to be used by the server user when accessing various external HTTPS REST resources (in the `utils.interface.webservice:HTTPSCertKeyHandler` block).

   
#. Copy grants template for mysql to default location and edit the contents.
   ::

      cd dynamo
      cp mysql/grants.json.template mysql/grants.json

   Enter the user passwords. This file specifies what user accounts and permission grants should be created on the MySQL server. By default, four users are created with different usage classes.

   - `dynamosrv` is the MySQL user with full access to all relevant databases. This is the database user account employed by the main Dynamo server. The password for `dynamosrv` should not be readable by normal users.
   - `dynamo` is the MySQL user with full access for all practical purposes running the Dynamo applications but cannot modify the inventory content.
   - `dynamoread` is the restricted-access MySQL user designed for read-only applications.
   - `dynamofod` is the MySQL user specialized for performing file transfer and deletion operations.

   The MySQL users will be created on the fly during the installation if they do not exist already.

   Else the default configuration should work for most cases.


Add a User
..........

All users must be authorized before interacting with the Dynamo server. To add a user, use `dynamo-user-auth` as super-user:
::
  
  source /usr/local/dynamo/etc/profile.d/init.sh
  dynamo-user-auth --user <user name> --dn "<user certificate DN>" --role admin

The option `--role admin` creates a new role named `admin`. Roles are user attributes employed within Dynamo server user management scheme to control access to various resources. Further application-specific authorization can be added using the same script. See the `--help` option for more details.


Validate Full Setup
...................

With the server running, use the `dynamo` command as one of the authorized users, not as root.
::

  $ dynamo

  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ DYNAMO +++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++  v2.1  +++++++++++++++
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
  >>> 

An interactive session appears with an interface with the full functionality of the python interpreter. The only difference from the normal python interpreter is that the session loaded with a preset object `inventory`, which represents the Dynamo server inventory. Initial data injection can be validated by inspecting the inventory object:

::

  >>> inventory.datasets
  {}
  >>> inventory.sites
  {}
