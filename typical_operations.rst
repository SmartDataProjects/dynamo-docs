Typical Operations
------------------

Dynamo has been written to reduce the number of interactions of humans with the storage system to a minimum. The main task humans have to do is to write policies for the storage. Policies can be very simple but they can also offer a very flexible use of the storage accounting for many different requirements each setup implies. Making sure that the system has enough storage at its disposal is the other task that the operators have to perform.

The task of adding new data to the system (injection) and invalidating data that are already in the system are occasionally done by hand so operators need to know how to do this safely. Even more rarely general deletion campaigns are useful to remove data from the system that really are not useful anymore. In CMS this process happens maybe twice a year after for example a big reprocessing has finished and users have moved away from the original processing. Deletion campaigns have to be approved by the physics organization and Dynamo offers a rich set of tools to study deletions following requirements on many different metadata.


Policy Building Blocks
......................

Policies are statements based on operators, regular expression matching and basic building blocks. Building blocks are:
 1. sites
 2. replica
 3. blockreplica
 4. dataset

Their detailed description is given in `here<https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo/blob/master/lib/policy/variables.py>`_.
