Dynamo - Dynamic Data Management System
=======================================

The development of Dynamo has started in 2014 by the Computing Operations organization and was initially foreseen to be a tool sitting on top of the existing CMS data transfer engine phedex. During the last year Dynamo evolved to take over the organization of the data transfers and provide a complete package to manage data using, DBS as the source for the definition of the metadata, FTS to perform the data transfers and the CMS popularity service to track the usage of the data.
